# NativeScript Angular 101

## v1
Learn how NativeScript integrates with Angular and how Angular’s platform agnostic nature make it possible to 
build truly native iOS and Android applications with TypeScript. Together we’ll build a real-world application that covers the mechanics of both framework. We’ll show the developer workflow we recommend - scaffolding and livesyncing, debugging with Chrome Dev Tools, writing UI tests in TypeScript with Appium.

#v2
Learn how NativeScript integrates with Angular and how Angular’s platform agnostic nature make it possible to build truly native iOS and Android applications with JavaScript or TypeScript. 

We will have a short introduction to NativeScript - how it works and how it integrates with Angular. Then we’ll go trough the whole developer workflow: project setup, scaffolding and livesyncing, debugging with Chrome Dev Tools, writing UI tests in TypeScript with Appium. Hopefully, at the end of this talk you will have a pretty good idea of it is to build apps with NativeScript.
